# Fake News

<img src="https://media.giphy.com/media/l3q2PMwmOGtezj8s0/giphy.gif">


In this project I've created a fake news site which contains 10 different articles by 5 different authors. 
The project is written in PHP, HTML and CSS. 


Instructions:
Clone the project with Git / Github Desktop.
Start a localhost server from your command line.
<br>
    ```
    "php -S localhost:8000"
    ```
<br>
Launch the website with your localhost server in your preferred browser.
